# Pets and Owners

[Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) is a web application framework for Node.js. It is designed for building web applications and APIs.

[nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) is a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

Remember to `npm init` before installing these two packages, and to setup your `.gitignore` file so that you don't commit your `node_modules`!

### Tools

1. [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download/) to preview your requests

### Objectives

1. Learn how to get a simple web server up and running using express
2. Learn handling simple GET requests on your server
3. Learn to read queries from the request your sever receives
4. Learn to use the body of POST/PATCH requests

## Intro

This sprint will help you get used to express as well as recap over the use of the file system module.

## Tasks

Now you will need to create a new express server that will implement the following:

In this sprint, we are going to create a fully functioning server that can handle the following requests:

- GET
- POST
- PATCH
- DELETE

All of these routes should start with `/api/` as we are creating an API. Make them restful!

Remember to use `nodemon` so that you do not have to keep manually restarting your express server!

### Day 1 - GET endpoints to implement:

1. GET `/owners/:id` - responds with the relevant owner's data
   
2. GET `/owners` - responds with an array containing the data of every owner  (_hint: you will need to use [fs.readdir](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/node-js-fs-readdir-method/) to read all of the file names in the owners folder_)
   
3. GET `/owners/:id/pets` - responds with an array containing the data of all pets belonging to the relevant owner
   
4. GET `/pets` - responds with an array containing all of the pets' data. This endpoint should accept a query of `temperament` so that users can filter pets by their temperament, e.g. `GET /api/pets?temperament=grumpy` responds with an array containing all the pets with a `temperament` of `grumpy`
   
5. GET `/pets/:id` - responds with the data of the relevant pet

### Day 2 - PATCH, POST & DELETE endpoints to implement:

_don't forget to use `express.json()` to access the request body! & think about what the endpoint for each of the below should be_

1. PATCH: update an owners name and age.

2. POST: add an owner

   - Must be the same format as the existing data (contain the same information), you should check the other owner files for this.
   - Use a timestamp for the id ([Date.now()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/now) might be useful), affixed with the relevant letter, "o" to avoid overwriting an existing file

3. POST: add a pet to an owner (owner must exist) - /owners/:id/pets

   - Must be the same format as the existing data (contain the same information), you should check the other pet files for this.
   - Use a timestamp for the id ([Date.now()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/now) might be useful), affixed with the relevant letter, "p" to avoid overwriting an existing file

4. DELETE: remove a pet from the data

5.  DELETE: remove an owner (and therefore, also remove any of their pets)

## Advanced Tasks

11. Read about [Application level middleware](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html#middleware.application).

12. Create log.txt file in the root directory and a logger middleware function that writes the following to the bottom of the log file:

- request method
- requested url
- time of the request

Read about [Error Handling](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/error-handling.html).

1.  Add some error handling to your routes. Think about how the user could make a bad request to your endpoints and respond with an appropriate status code. 

## Super Advanced Tasks

14. Update the all pets endpoint (task 4) and allow it to accept the following queries

- `sort_by` - user can choose to order the pets by:
  - `id` - should default to this when no query is given.
  - `age`
  - `name`
- `order` - can accept `asc` or `desc` (defaults to `asc` when the query isn't given.)
- `max_age` - user can choose to only bring pets younger than passed query
- `min_age` - user can choose to only bring pets older than passed query
- `search` - user can pass a searchTerm that will filter pets to only include those who have the searchTerm in _any_ of their properties
